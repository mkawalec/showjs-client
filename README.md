Show.js client
==============

Synchronised presentations for the masses!


A rough plan from future features:

- [x] An indicator showing the current position
- [ ] Tests!
- [ ] Ability to add comments to the slide at a given position (saved in localStore)
- [ ] Comments can be sent to everyone / everyone but master
- [ ] Comments can be replied to, upvoted / downvoted
- [ ] A screen showing the breakdown of comments (most useful on master)
- [ ] Account at the server at which someone can log in
- [ ] Comments to a presentation can be saved on the account

Styling has a high priority and should happen somewhere along the way.
It needs a thorough discussion if we want to support more presentation engines than Reveal.js
